# CAGE: Cache-Aware Graphlet Enumeration

## Building
Make sure you have the `cmake` version >= 3.5 and `make` utilities installed.
Then, issue these commands:
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j CAGE
```

The executable file CAGE will be created in the `build` directory. 

## Usage

You can run CAGE using
```bash
./CAGE <path_to_input_graph> <k> [edge list format]
```

The last parameter is optional and if specified will cause the program to interpret the input file in the edge list format (see below).

## Graph Format
The main graph format used is as follows:
First row should contain the number of vertices n.
Then, n rows with `index degree` (separated by a space) with the degrees of each vertex.
Then the edge list of the graph, one edge per row `u v`.

If the third parameter is passed on the command line, then only the edge list may be supplied.
Vertex indices should start from 0.
